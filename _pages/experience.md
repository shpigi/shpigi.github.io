## Senior Staff Machine Learning Engineer <span style="float: right; font-size: 0.8em; font-style: italic;">Nov 2022 - Present</span>
### Kindred, Part of Ocado Group

* Developed machine learning models for robotic control, including data processing pipelines for training control models such as Diffusion Policy and ACT models. 
* Designed scalable data processing and training pipelines for classification tasks like double pick detection and item recognition. Collaborated with an inventory recognition team to reduce double picks, achieving an 80% recall rate with minimal impact on system throughput.
* Built A/B testing analysis tools and advocated for the integration of performance monitoring tools.
* Partnered with cross-functional teams to implement ML training pipelines.
* Mentored colleagues and interns on machine learning projects.

## Staff Machine Learning Engineer <span style="float: right; font-size: 0.8em; font-style: italic;">Sep 2017 - Oct 2022</span>
### Kindred, Part of Ocado Group

* Created the company's first robotic grasping ML components, leveraging segmentation, multi-outcome prediction, and classical image processing techniques. Achieved grasp success rates exceeding 95%.
* Optimized and fine-tuned robotic systems in production environments across four product lines, enhancing performance and reliability.
* Developed item identification and tracking models using SKU-level representation embeddings, reducing wrong-item grasping by over 80%.
* Promoted cloud-based solutions for data processing (Vertex AI pipelines), model training (Ray), and experimentation monitoring (ClearML). Also developed in-house A/B testing tools.

## Research Staff Member <span style="float: right; font-size: 0.8em; font-style: italic;">2012 - Jul 2017</span>
### IBM Research, Machine Learning for Healthcare Group

* Led projects analyzing electronic medical records and health system activity data for prediction and policy analysis. For example, used a Bayesian model of HPV-triggered cervical cancer and public data from Kenya to estimate disease prevalence across provinces.
* Conducted neuroscience research on functional connectivity using EEG, fMRI, and neurofeedback. Focused on inferring fMRI-like information from EEG and studying brain activation dynamics during emotional changes.
* Advised PhD and postdoc interns and taught internal machine learning courses.
* Developed ML tools for anomaly detection, clustering, and prediction in neuroscience and healthcare datasets.

## Research Staff Member <span style="float: right; font-size: 0.8em; font-style: italic;">Apr 2008 - 2011</span>
### IBM Research, Machine Learning and Data Mining Group

* Designed machine learning algorithms for a bank's fraud detection system, reducing false positives by 50% while maintaining alert accuracy. The system used a random forest model with customized feature vectors representing recent customer activities.
* Created anomaly detection methods for large system logs in a mainframe monitoring solution. The system identified anomalies by learning message distribution statistics and appearance relationships.
* Provided guidance on integrating research into IBM product offerings.
* Programmed in Matlab and C++.

## Teaching Assistant <span style="float: right; font-size: 0.8em; font-style: italic;">2001 - 2006</span>
### Hebrew University

* Lectured in Dynamic Systems and Control courses.
* Assisted in teaching Digital Systems courses.

## Software Developer <span style="float: right; font-size: 0.8em; font-style: italic;">1997 - 2002</span>
### Elbit Systems

* Developed rapid prototypes for helicopter "glass cockpit" upgrades. Allowing for testing of system specifications prior to firmware implementation.
