excerpt: 'Introduced a novel method, CRNDA, for delineating context-dependent functional brain networks based on connectivity dynamics analysis. Applied to fMRI data, the study identified networks aligned with emotional intensity during naturalistic stimuli, revealing empathy-related and functional processing networks.'
